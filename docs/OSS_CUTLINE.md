# HELM OSS Scope Cutline

> This document defines the boundary between what HELM OSS ships today and what the specification describes.

HELM OSS targets **L1/L2 core conformance**. The specification contains L3, enterprise, and 2030 extensions that are not part of the current OSS release.

For the authoritative scope definition, see [OSS_SCOPE.md](OSS_SCOPE.md).

## Boundary Invariant

OSS must remain fully useful standalone. The commercial layer adds organizational governance around the kernel — not artificial crippleware.
