## Kernel TCB (Trusted Computing Base)

The canonical TCB is bounded to **8 packages** — the minimal trusted core.
See [TCB_POLICY.md](TCB_POLICY.md) for the authoritative package list,
expansion criteria, and CI enforcement details.

## Active OSS Packages

The following packages are part of the OSS kernel, including both TCB and
non-TCB supporting infrastructure:

## Removed from TCB (Enterprise)

The following packages were removed to minimize the attack surface:
