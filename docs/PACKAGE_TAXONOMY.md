# HELM Package Taxonomy

Classification of all 83 directories in `core/pkg/`.

## Legend

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **TCB** | 8 | Trusted Computing Base — the irreducible security boundary |
| **Supporting** | 32 | Infrastructure required by the TCB or CLI commands |
| **Extension** | 24 | Protocol extensions, adapters, and integrations |
| **Enterprise-origin** | 12 | Features that originated in commercial development |
| **Internal** | 7 | Utilities and internal abstractions |

## TCB — Trusted Computing Base (8)

These packages form the fail-closed execution boundary. Nothing else is required for HELM's core security guarantee.

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `guardian/` | Policy Enforcement Point — PRG evaluation, decision signing, fail-closed deny |
| `crypto/` | Ed25519 signing, verification, key management, canonicalization |
| `contracts/` | Canonical types: Receipt, DecisionRecord, Effect, Intent, Verdict |
| `prg/` | Proof Requirement Graph — rule evaluation, policy engine |
| `executor/` | SafeExecutor — governed tool execution with receipt emission |
| `conform/` | Conformance engine — gate evaluation, profile matching |
| `canonicalize/` | JCS canonicalization, deterministic hashing |
| `store/` | Receipt persistence (SQLite + Postgres) |

---

## Supporting Infrastructure (32)

| `authz/` | Authorization policies, RBAC primitives |
| `boundary/` | Boundary check helpers, scope validation |
| `budget/` | Budget tracking, cost accounting, ceiling enforcement |
| `buildguard/` | Build-time guard constraints |
| `bundles/` | Bundle management, artifact packaging |
| `capabilities/` | Capability registry, tool declaration |
| `certification/` | Conformance certification artifacts |
| `config/` | Configuration loading, `helm.yaml` parsing |

| `effects/` | Effect type registry, dispatch |
| `envelope/` | Effect envelope validation |
| `evidence/` | Evidence collection, chain building |
| `evidencepack/` | EvidencePack archive creation and extraction |
| `firewall/` | Egress control, network policy enforcement |
| `identity/` | Principal identity, delegation sessions, isolation |
| `intent/` | Execution intent management |
| `kernel/` | Kernel primitives: CSNF, CEL-DP, Merkle, FreezeController |
| `kernelruntime/` | Runtime lifecycle, intent submission |
| `manifest/` | Schema manifest loading and validation |
| `merkle/` | Merkle tree utilities (separate from kernel) |
| `pdp/` | Policy Decision Point interface for external policy backends |
| `proofgraph/` | ProofGraph DAG construction and traversal |
| `receipts/` | Receipt helpers, chain validation |
| `sandbox/` | Sandbox execution, isolation primitives |
| `trust/` | Trust root management, key ceremony |
| `verifier/` | EvidencePack verification, signature checking |
