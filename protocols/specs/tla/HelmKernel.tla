---- MODULE HelmKernel ----
\* TLA+ Formal Model for the HELM Kernel
\* This specifies the safety invariants for the Guardian → Executor pipeline.

EXTENDS Naturals, Sequences, FiniteSets

CONSTANTS
    Principals,     \* Set of all principals (agents, humans)
    Tools,          \* Set of all available tools
    Policies        \* Set of all policies

VARIABLES
    proofGraph,     \* Sequence of ProofGraph nodes
    lamportClock,   \* Monotonically increasing Lamport counter
    decisions,      \* Set of active decision records
    receipts,       \* Set of generated receipts
    trustRoot       \* Set of trusted signing keys

\* Type invariant
TypeInvariant ==
    /\ lamportClock \in Nat
    /\ lamportClock >= 0
    /\ proofGraph \in Seq([
        nodeHash: STRING,
        kind: {"DECISION", "EXECUTION", "RECEIPT", "ESCALATION"},
        principal: Principals,
        lamport: Nat
       ])

\* === SAFETY INVARIANTS ===

\* S1: Fail-Closed — No execution without a valid decision
FailClosed ==
    \A r \in receipts:
        \E d \in decisions: d.id = r.decisionId /\ d.verdict = "ALLOW"

\* S2: Monotonic Lamport — ProofGraph is strictly ordered
MonotonicLamport ==
    \A i \in 1..Len(proofGraph)-1:
        proofGraph[i].lamport < proofGraph[i+1].lamport

\* S3: Receipt Completeness — Every execution produces a receipt
ReceiptCompleteness ==
    \A e \in {n \in Range(proofGraph): n.kind = "EXECUTION"}:
        \E r \in receipts: r.executionNodeHash = e.nodeHash

\* S4: Principal Binding — Every node is bound to a principal
PrincipalBinding ==
    \A n \in Range(proofGraph):
        n.principal \in Principals

\* S5: Hash Chain Integrity — Every non-genesis node references valid parents
HashChainIntegrity ==
    \A i \in 2..Len(proofGraph):
        \E j \in 1..i-1:
            proofGraph[j].nodeHash \in proofGraph[i].parents

\* === STATE TRANSITIONS ===

\* Guardian evaluates a decision request
EvaluateDecision(principal, tool, action) ==
    /\ principal \in Principals

    /\ LET newLamport == lamportClock + 1
           decision == [

\* Executor runs an allowed effect
ExecuteEffect(decisionId) ==
    /\ \E d \in decisions:
        /\ d.id = decisionId
        /\ d.verdict = "ALLOW"
        /\ LET newLamport == lamportClock + 1

                   lamport |-> newLamport
               ]
